# UFOs - Fact or Fiction?

## Overview

### Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis is to improve a webpage displaying numerous UFO sightings over the years. This improvement would provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria (city, state, country, and UFO shape) at the same time. More specifically, the purpose to practice HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Results

The website allows the user to type in various filter inputs so to return certain UFO sighting instances. Our app.js file allows the reading of such inputs so that they are read into the HTML file.

### Summary

One drawback of this page is the lack of account for different formatting of inputs. For example, typing in "CA" instead of the suggested "ca" returns nothing.

We recommend modifications that can take in any type of (correct) spelling for inputs. We also recommend improving the formatting of the introductory text "Are we alone in the universe..." with the secondary heading "UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy? Ufologists Weigh In." There is uneeded white space on the side.
